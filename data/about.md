Cathie Pilkington is an artist whose work engages passionately and critically with the canonical history of figurative sculpture. Crossing the borders of traditional, modern and contemporary idioms, her work combines intensively modelled and painted sculptures within immersive installations comprising a diverse array of props, materials and studio furniture. Her site-responsive installations are balanced ambivalently between chaos and precision and have been described as a kind of art historical fly-tipping.  
  
Pilkington studied at Edinburgh College of Art (1986-91) and The Royal College of Art (1995-97).  
She was elected a Royal Academician in 2014 and became the first female professor of Sculpture at the Royal Academy Schools 2016-2019.  
In 2020 she was elected Keeper of the Royal Academy of Art, London.  
  
Her work is held in the collections of Pallant House Gallery, Chichester; DESTE Foundation for Contemporary Art, Athens; Manchester Art Gallery, Manchester; The Huntarian, Glasgow; Omer Koc Collection and the Roberts Institute of Art.
